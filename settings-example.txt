## TL/DR: If you sell your cards, choose "mostvalue"; otherwise, "leastcards".
##
## sort = "mostvalue"
## This option will tell Idle Master that you would like to idle the games with
## the highest market value of available cards first, then work down the list
## until it idles the game with the lowest card market value last.  This is
## accomplished by using the Enhanced Steam API to pull the average price per
## card drop of each game you need to idle and multiplying it by the number of
## available drops.  Because of the additional data requests that this
## requires, setting this option will cause additional waiting time when the
## program is first starting up.
## *** This option is the best way to maximize your profits from idling.
##
## sort = "leastcards"
## Similar to the mostcards option, but in reverse.  Idle Master will begin by
## idling the game with the least number of cards available first, and then
## work its way down the list until it idles the game with the highest number
## of remaining card drops last.
## *** This option is the best way to maximize the number of games in which
## *** you're eligible for a booster pack.
##
## sort = "mostcards"
## Idle Master will begin by idling the game which has the highest number of
## available card drops, and work its way down the list until it idles the game
## with the least number of available card drops.
##
## sort = ""
## If no sorting preference is set, Idle Master will simply idle your games in
## the order in which they are displayed on your badge progress page (more or
## less, this is random).
##
## sort = "leastvalue"
## Similar to the mostvalue option, but in reverse.  This option will tell Idle
## Master that you would like to start idling the least valuable cards first,
## and work down the list until you finish by idling the most valuable cards.
## I'm honestly not sure why you would want to do this, but hey why not, right?
## Because of the additional data requests that this requires, setting this
## option will cause additional waiting time when the program is first starting
